        # ðŸš€ Project Kickoff â€” Pre-Flight Checklist

        Before writing the first line of code, letâ€™s make sure all systems are good.  
        
        This checklist is meant to guide devs through the *thinking phase* of the project â€” 
        ensuring they have clarity on the problem, scope, architecture, risks, and rollout strategy.

        After reading the project pitch, go through this checklist and make sure there are tasks
        created in the project for handling each of these.
